# Future Plans

The current version is the initial release of Read Frog. Many additional features are planned, including:

1. Translating and explaining only selected portions of web pages
2. Vocabulary notebook for recording new words with context sentences
3. Voice explanations like a real teacher
4. E-book support
5. Mobile support
6. And more...

The core purpose of all our features is to help users deeply learn English through content they find interesting. Whether it's news, books, or any material you want to understand in depth or keep up with current events.

We need more users centered around this language learning purpose to help us raise questions, suggest features, and co-create the product. We believe the future of Read Frog has limitless possibilities.
